### [Click here to use the converter.](https://travisgk.github.io/long-s-converter/)
This online tool accurately inserts the historical long S character (&nbsp;Å¿&nbsp;) back into text in order to make it appear as if it were written before the 20th century.

English, French, German, Spanish and Italian are supported.

## Python Repo
This is a JavaScript version of my original Python code found at [py-long-s](https://github.com/travisgk/py-long-s).

## Special Thanks
Thank you Andrew West of the TeX Users Group for the documentation found under [The Rules for Long S](https://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb32-1/tb100west.pdf), which was fundamental in writing the conversion functions for English, French, Spanish, and Italian.
